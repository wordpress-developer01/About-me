# 💼 JavaScript Portfolio Projects

Hi! My name is Murat. I’m an aspiring Full Stack Engineer currently studying Software Engineering at university Sabahattin Zaim and learning independently through platforms like Codecademy. My goal is to build high-quality web applications and continuously improve my skills through real-world projects and contributions.

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects developed as part of my learning and portfolio.

## 🌟 Project 1: [big-project.js](https://github.com/wordpress-developer01/code-projects/blob/main/big-project.js)


**Description:**  
This project is a motivational message generator built for a portfolio assignment on Codecademy. It demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation, functions, and random selection logic.

**What it does:**
- Randomly selects one phrase from each of the three arrays: `firstly`, `secondly`, and `thirdly`;
- Combines them into a complete motivational message;
- Logs the result to the console;
- Each execution gives a new, unique message.

**Sample Output:**

```bash
$ node big-project.js

🌟 Your message for today 🌟

Don't forget: even a mistake is part of success. Do something useful.
```
